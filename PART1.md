Change date, adults, child and infant, works, the addition also, unintuitive scrolling. It does not allow you to select a hotel without the tour.

To continue with the test, you must book with a tour.

I Continue as Guest without filling in anything, it asks you First Name, Last Name, email, confirm email, required. Email confirmation works. It looks for the @ and .com to approve it.

Write up:

The goal is to check that booking a hotel works. The search engine does not work, so the only way that remains is through Featured Tours, although the Tour cannot be separated from the hotel.
The site has many errors, it would be necessary to do a more detailed exploration to report them one by one, the only thing that seems to coincide are the data selected at the beginning and options that are preserved at the end, but they are not integrated with the data or availability of the Tours.
To prioritize use cases, first  I start with the easiest and most obvious option, the search engine. Then by the options that appear on the screen and finally a log is made in case there is any more option added.
For this type of application it is very important to check everything related to dates, availability and quantities. The pay works correctly is essential.
