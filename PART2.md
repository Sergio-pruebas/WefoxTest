The Script has been made in Maven since it offers more possibilities, such as the launch in Codeship.

The TestNG has been used since the integration with TestLink and Jenkins is more complete.

Firefox is used.

Geckodriver download dependencies.

The screeshots have been sent to a PHP since this allows the integration with Codeship, ideally that PHP should be in a Testlink server or similar, 
in this case it has been hosted in 000Webhost.

At 000Webhost test everyone for their free hosting, expect some network fails.
